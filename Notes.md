## Personal notes but also may be interesting

Disclaimer - originally I wanted to do it because I decided to leave the company and work on D language and get x2 the money, at least that much on paper. In reality it would still be a lot more.

But water flows and world changes even faster and now I stay in Tinkoff, but different strategy and different team, even programming language is likely different. But it was a good idea and I followed up on it.

1. I want to shame bad stuff and make at least half of you "experts" on full-text search. As if there is somthing special about it to begin with, really.

2. More exploration, moar exploitation(!) and above of all it *must be fun*.

3. If we don't like log filles - I think we can get a bunch ofsay MP3s (~10k is more then enough) and start searching over that with playback if you'd like... Kill Yandex Music / Apple Music in 1.5h :)

4. I want real examples, real fedback and real you. Show that you can think and have imagination for use cases of full-text search. I'm challenging you, right here!

5. I'd like to stay simple and we'll have only as much code as we absolutely need. And sorry, no Scala or Monads. I don't need that ugly shit to show you the power of ElasticSearch. PArticularly because I want us to be equal, including devops and other non-Scala people.

6. Again to *deliver a god damn point* - *ElasticSearch is a server, and no(!) Java and transport client is not(!) really faster*. Yes, I know it's *binary*, but no - it is not any faster in practice and awkward bitch to deal with. Again - there is nothing of value in using only Java/JVM language with ElasticSearch. Even fucking shellscript with curl can use it very well.

7. Make sure I say at least once, that *scripts in ElasticSearch are good but it's like transactions* - *you don't need them, untill you actually do*.
