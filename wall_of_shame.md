## Products that awfully fail the full-text search test


| Company |   Product   | Date of fail | What doesn't work           |
|---------|------------ |--------------|-----------------------------|
| Apple   | Apple Music | 2018-06-26   | Almost all attempts to do even slightly fuzzy search fail which scares the shit out of me. Bllions of dollars,  and yet crapy shit instead of sensible full-text search. My favorite "Cold lay" - finds "lay me down" -> some other track that is not even "prefix correct" for my query! |
